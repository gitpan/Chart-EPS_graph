Chart-EPS_graph

This module generates pretty XY and XYY graphs. All you have to do is 
compose your titles and provide your channel data as an array of arrays. 
Perl will then hand over your choices to the Ghostscript interpreter for
PostScript along with all the necessary PostScript routines to make a 
very pretty (or hideously ugly...as in my Test.pm example) XY or XYY
2-D graph.

You may use any of the 143 named colors common to web browsers. You 
may have any number of traces on either of two Y axes (left and right).
You may use any font known to Ghostscript. The only notable limitation 
is that no single data channel (curve, line) may exceed 65,535 points.

Freedom is yours to make graphs beautiful or hideously ugly. An example of
how HotPink font characters and grid lines look on DarkOliveGreen, run the 
Test.pm module and aflict your eyes with '/some/dir/foo.eps.png' (Ugh!).
After installation, type into the CLI like so...

perl -e "use Chart::EPS_graph::Test; print Chart::EPS_graph::Test->full_test('/some/dir/');"
